# :diving_mask: DiveSafe Project

## Project Overview

DiveSafe Java Application written by a team at McGill University


DiveSafe is an app for the small imaginary island of Atlantis. It must be used by any potential visitor to the island to register as a member and to book dive guides, equipment, and hotels for any diving trips. The first phase of the project was to create a domain model using Umple and generating java code from this model. The second phase involved implementing the controller methods of the different features of the application. In the third phase, we implemented the state-based behavior of the application in the Model/Controller layer. The final phase involved the implementation of the user interface with JavaFX UI libraries.
